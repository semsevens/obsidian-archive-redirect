==========================================

This folder is created and maintained by the Archive Redirect Obsidian plugin.

Files here are NAMED by SHA1 of remote URLs (<hash>.<ext>) and referenced from
notes via HTML <img>/<video>/<audio> at render time. They do NOT appear in any
markdown ![]() or [[wikilink]] in your notes.

⚠️  WARNING — DO NOT clean this folder with third-party "orphan attachment"
   plugins. They scan only markdown link syntax and will flag every file here
   as orphaned. Running them will silently destroy your link-rot archive,
   INCLUDING content whose source URLs are already dead and unrecoverable.

   Known dangerous combinations:
     - oz-clear-unused-images
     - Local Images Plus' "Remove orphaned attachments" commands
     - Any tool that "garbage-collects unused attachments"

   Either DO NOT run such tools while Archive Redirect is in use, OR
   exclude this folder from their scope.
